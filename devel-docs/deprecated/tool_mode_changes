Layout Mode comments: (July 28, 07)

Overall:
Lets copy inkscape's UI as much as is reasonable.  BUT: remember, we are
annotating plots, not making icons!

  -in layout mode, we need a toolbar to select the various tools.

Handles:
  -need mouseover feedback on handles (inkscape changes colours)
  -need feedback on potential selection. Inkscape uses mouse feedback,
   but since most objects will over a plot, this is mostly useless.  I think
   showing ghost handles would be better.
  -Handle dimensions should be fixed and should not depend on window/object/
   parent size.
   (It could be cool to have the size fixed relative to the screen size.)
  -Handles should lie outside the object so that they are accesible with 0
   size objects (eg, horizontal line).
  -Handles need to have some indication what they are/do (like inkscape).
  -to get to rotate mode, you have to click twice, which is too much like
   a double click (which calls up the properties dialog).  So, get rid
   of double click to properties dialog.  Instead get it from the rmb or
   from button 2. 
  -On resize, you should be able flip through zero to mirror the object.
   This is especially important for lines.
  -Sometimes clicking on an object does not bring up the handles.
   Is this a bug, or just a different mode?

Line Properties:
  -By default, line properties should depend on the size (width + height) of
   the page/TopLevelView/Window and should not depend on the aspect ratio of
   the object, or its parent or the TLV.  This includes:
    -line widths
    -dash dimensions
    -arrow dimensions
    -Ends of wide lines - (should be always perpendicular to line)
   so,
    -resizing an object and not the window should not change its line
     widths. NOTE: this is not the same behavior as inkscape.
    -The vertical and horizontal lines of a box should always be equal 
     regardless of any resizing.
  -For 2.x, we should consider a per-object option to allow the line properties
   to be a function of the parent size, rather than the TLV size. 
  -Line property units should be 'points, if printed to US Letter'

Aspect ratio
  -All objects except lines should have a 'preserve aspect ratio' option.
     -Fonts and Pictures should default to having this set. 
     -All others should default to this unset. 
  -When it is set, changing the aspect ratio of the object's parent or TLV will
   not change the aspect ratio of the objects
  -When it is set, moving the grab boxes should uniformly scale the object
   (but not Line Properties).
  -When it is set, rotations need to be in display space, to preserve
   relative angle.
  SO:
     -rectangles stay rectangles
     -fonts don't get distorted
  -When it is not set, rotations are in the (0-1, 0-1) space, so objects
   will only preserve their apparent aspect ratio if the TLV is square.


Object Specific changes:
Labels:
  -To create a lable, click to location, which pops up the dialog (same as 1.4)
   Apply/OK on dialog draws the label.  In the first instance, we don't need
   to support in-place text editing.

Dialogs:
  -Inkscape uses multiple dialogs to edit different properties of an object.
   We should not.  Use tabbed dialogs instead.
  -They need to support everything the 1.4 dialogs support.
