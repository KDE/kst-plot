# SSDB datasource

Open `ssdb://127.0.0.1:43234` (or `127.0.0.1:43234`) in Kst while the
SSDB server is running. Each SSDB scalar **time series** is a Kst vector;
enter the address directly into the datasource field in the New Vector or
Change File dialog (the file-browser button browses local files only).
`localhost` is mapped to `127.0.0.1`: the current Rust consumer tries only
the first resolved address, which may otherwise be IPv6 `::1` even if the
server is listening only on IPv4.
The synthetic Kst vector `INDEX` has one sample per frame, equal to that
frame's number, and can be used as an X axis. Reads extending past the last
frame return only the available frames. The name `INDEX` is reserved and takes
precedence over an SSDB field of the same name.
SSDB vector and matrix streams are not supported yet. `FRAMES` is a Kst
scalar, and `FILE` is the server address string. Field units, quantity, nominal
rate and samples-per-frame are available as vector metadata.

Frame 0 is the Unix epoch. The datasource configuration dialog sets the frame
rate (default 5 Hz) and an end delay (default 100 ms); both are saved in the
Kst session and per-server settings. Each field's samples per frame is fixed at
connection time to round(nominal field rate / frame rate), at least one. All
fields share the same frame boundaries. The latest frame is the last boundary
not later than the latest timestamp **across all SSDB streams** minus the end
delay. New field registrations become visible on reopening the datasource.

**Choose a recent starting frame or count from the end.** Reading from epoch
frame 0 to the present would require billions of frames; Kst rejects such a
request before allocation. At 5 Hz, a starting frame for a Unix timestamp in
seconds is approximately `timestamp * 5`.

For historical data, start the **SSDB database server** with
`--read-from-disk`. By default it reads only the most recent data retained in
RAM (about 60 seconds, or roughly 300 frames at 5 Hz), even though older
samples may already be stored on disk. Kst cannot change this server setting;
without it, older requests return zero-valued samples while `INDEX` still
returns valid frame numbers. Restart the database server with the flag to read
older data; restarting Kst alone does not enable historical reads.
If older ranges still contain inconsistent zero gaps with disk reads enabled,
rebuild and restart the database server: older server binaries could over-read
the final disk chunk in a time-window request and silently return zeros for
the whole window. The Kst plugin alone cannot repair that server-side read.

## Limitations of the current C API

The API returns resampled values without raw sample timestamps. It currently
performs zero-order hold for *all* scalar types, including floating point. It
cannot reliably distinguish a missing sample before the first measurement from
a genuine zero, so NaN-before-first and linear interpolation are not yet
possible. After a field's last reported sample, the datasource attempts to
hold that value. The C API also does not report the actual length or error
status of returned scalar arrays, so empty intervals and transport failures
cannot always be distinguished. Correct boundary behavior and float-linear
interpolation require a future timestamped-sample API with explicit status
and memory-management functions.

To build the optional plugin, configure Kst with `SSDB_WORKSPACE_ROOT` set to
the cmd-tlm workspace containing the `telemetry_c` crate. By default Kst
looks for a sibling `ss/cmd-tlm` workspace. The build uses Cargo and the
corresponding generated C header from that workspace.
The linked `telemetry_c` must return typed scalar tokens from
`consumer_register_scalar`; older builds boxed a generic token instead,
causing scalar reads to return zeros. Rebuild the plugin when updating the
Rust library and restart Kst to load the new module.
